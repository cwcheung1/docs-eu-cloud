The procedures for deploying an application to CloudHub in the EU control plane is similar to those in the US control plane. See xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub].

However, consider the following differences when deploying to the EU control plane.

* The EU control plane supports a smaller number of  Mule runtimes than the US control plane.
* The domain name of CloudHub workers is `<app_name>.de.eu1.cloudhub.io`.
* You can only deploy to the Frankfurt or Dublin regions from the EU control plane.
* Applications deployed to the EU control plane use Object Store v2.
